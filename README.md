## Organization
The code in this repo is contained in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. Both files contain all functions necessary to build the social network graph, compute probabilites, and run the simulation.


[MFF Clean](https://github.com/gmandell23/MFF/blob/main/MFF%20Clean-Scale%20Up.ipynb) contains the code that generates the plots tracking spreaders, non-spreaders, and unreached trees for a graph of 5000 nodes.

[MFF 3D](https://github.com/gmandell23/MFF/blob/main/MFF%20FINAL-3D%20surface.ipynb) contains the code that runs the simulation for different tweet and retweet probability scale factors, and plots the composition of the population in 2D and 3D graphs. At the end of the notebook is also the code that generates the visualization of the graph on the poster below:
